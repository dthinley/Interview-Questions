### Project: Answer the Following Interview Questions (6 total)
For each of the questions below, answer as if you were in an interview, explaining and justifying your answer with two to three paragraphs as you see fit. For coding answers, explain the relevant choices you made writing the code.

### 1. What is the most influential book or blog post you’ve read regarding web development?
Well, I cannot really say it as a blog post or book but back in the day when I was working as program coordinator in small town of northern India. I had opportunity to attend a workshop on Introductory to internet and HTML. I was so fascinated about the functioning of html. How connecting each tags in html results in something beautiful. My instructor during the class created this small contact list demo site where user can click on the list and shows the details of contact. And also can search contact from lists. And I thought wow this is so convenient for the user. That was my first ever influential thing that happened and wanted to be a web development some day in future.

### 2. Tell me about a web application you have built. Why did you choose to build it? What did you learn? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Just after completing this workshop on Introductory to internet and HTML, my first web application was to build an Internal Memo system for my office in hope of cutting down paper usage. The application was purely built on HTML. It took me quite a time to complete this project. And it was not the best project, but however it did serve the purposes. The greatest challenge of course is insufficient knowledge and resources. During that time internet was just introduce to our area, and internet connection was really slow that was in 1998. I tired my best to make the application looks goods and not crash on users. Since, I don’t know about the existence of CSS during that time. Placing items on its location was challenge. But somehow I look through other sites and copy some tags, use it for my project. 

### 3. Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is an HTML unordered list (ul /ul) of those strings. You should include a brief explanation of your code. Then, what would you have to consider if the original list was provided by user input?

### 4. List 2-3 attacks that web applications are vulnerable to. How do these attacks work? How can we prevent those attacks?
•	Carry out SQL injection attacks to gain access to the database, spoof a user’s identity, and destroy or alter data in the database. SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL statements are inserted into form fields to try and gather information from the database. This information enables the hacker to access, modify or destroy information in the database. \
•	Use Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to have browsers execute their malicious payloads to deface your website to promote their brand or their hacktivist ideals . XSS occurs when malicious code is injected into an application that executes on the client side.
•	Make the site temporarily unavailable with a Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS). DDoS attacks generate requests from thousands of IP addresses in an attempt to flood a site with traffic, making it impossible for the server to respond to requests. DDoS attacks or bots can slow a site down or make it temporarily unavailable.

#### Solution:
1.	Implementing CAPTCHA or prompting users to answer questions. This ensures that a form or request is being submitted by a human and not a bot.
2.	Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor your network and block potential attacks.

### 5. Here is some starter code for a Flask Web Application. Expand on that and include a route that simulates rolling two dice and returns the result in JSON. You should include a brief explanation of your code.

##### Refer: dice.py

*Route /dice.json returns the result of rolling two dice in json format, in a list of two rolled results, i.e. integers between 1 and 

### 6. If you were to start your full-stack developer position today, what would be your goals a year from now?
My goal from for a year from now will be continuing my professional and personal growth, using my newfound skills and applying the incredible passion that I have for all of the work that I do in order to help other people to learn and grow.
